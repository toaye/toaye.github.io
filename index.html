                    Hello, Aye. <br><br>

                    First of all, I wish you and your family a happy new year. May the new year bring all the good things in life that you truly deserve. Appreciate the loves you have got and let go of the disappointments on this fresh start.<br><br>

                    It has been more than four years and I still have not forgotten about you, not even once. I thought I could get over you if I'd distance myself from you. I guess I held on. I am sorry for leaving without saying goodbye.<br><br>

                    I promised that I would wait for you five years ago. I kept thinking about it every day. I made a wrong move and got easily driven by my emotions. I met Kristina and did like her because she was the very opposite of me. Little did I know, I was still not over you. It was very wrong thinking about you while in a relationship. I chose to fight and continue our relationship because I thought I could change my feelings for you. Four years passed, nothing has changed. I was very selfish that I have hurt so many people.<br><br>

                    Recently, we reunited again. My feelings for you grew stronger. I always looked forward to playing with you in Among Us. Your presence always makes me happy. Then, Genshin was released. I kept annoying you in your world. I always make time for you to help. I appreciate your time with our little adventures. Your actions made me confused. Maybe you were just too nice or maybe I am just stupid.<br><br>

                    I made a mistake. Everything is my fault. I easily got driven by my emotions. I know youâ€™ve already rejected me but your answers are still confusing. So, I am still not giving up on you, Aye. I will try again next time. Just take your time and I will take mine as well. Always remember that I am always here for you, Aye. If you need help, someone to talk to, a shoulder to lean on, I am still your friend. This time, I will try my best not to leave you anymore.<br><br>

                    Thank you so much for everything, Aye. Always be happy.<br><br>

                    Reach for the stars, Doc.<br><br>

                    Always,<br>
